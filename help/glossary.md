# Glossary
* **Node** - All data items in the instrument tree view (Instrument Files, Instruments, Waves)
* **Property** - Parameter of a Node which can have an assigned value.Instrument File - A Node which describes a collection of instruments stored in a file (.kvi) or as part of a compressed archive file (.kvz)
* **Instrument** - An Instrument is a Node and is described by a tree of multiple Waves and is what is assigned to a MIDI channel and played.
* **Wave** - The fundamental building block Node used in Instruments. Described by a Curve, several Properties, Morph Curves, and input and output Attribute Ports.Curve - A cubic BÃ©zier curve.Coordinates - Refers to both X and Y Coordinates combined.
* **Speaker** - An individual audio output channel.
* **Mix Node** - A specialized Node used in Instruments (the Instrument Node itself is a master Mix Node for the Instrument) for mixing signals to Speaker channels.
* **X Coordinate** - A position value in a Curve along the horizontal axis, from 0.0 to 1.0.Y Coordinate - A position value in a Curve along the vertical axis, from -1.0 to 1.0 (bipolar) or 0.0 to 1.0 (unipolar).
* **Point** - A point on a Curve described by an X and Y Coordinate (or H and V Coordinate for Morph Curves).
* **Target Point** - Points on a Curve which lie on the curve.Handle Point - Points used to control the slope of the curve between Target Points. Each Target Point has 2 handles (1 for End Points).
* **End Point** - The First Point or Last Point in a Curve.
* **Signal** - A stream of numeric floating point data which passes between synthesis Nodes.
* **Attribute** - An identifier of Signal content. Used for controlling how Waves and other synthesis nodes are interconnected. Examples: Volume, Pitch, Balance, and Effect.
* **Port** - An input or output Signal port of a synthesis Node (such as a Wave). Identified by an Attribute, which determines what other Node it is connected to.Waveform - The Curve output by a Wave node.
* **Morph Curve** - A Curve used to morph the X or Y Coordinate of a Point in a Waveform. There can be multiple Morph Curves used in a Waveform, one each to control the X or Y Coordinate of a Waveform.
* **H Coordinate** - The horizontal (X) Coordinate of a Morph Curve. Identified separately since Morph Curves can be used to morph either the X or Y coordinates of a Waveform.
* **V Coordinate** - The vertical or value (Y) Coordinate of a Morph Curve. Identified separately since Morph Curves can be used to morph either the X or Y coordinates of a Waveform.
* **Morph Key** - The H Coordinate of a Point on a Morph Curve.
